The implementation can be tested as below:

1. `python3 server.py --port PORT` for starting the server. It will start a CMD application and you should enter `create` and `start` commands.
2. `cd web && python3 manage.py runserver` for starting the Django application.
3. `cd websocket && python3 chatsrv-ws.py 5680`
